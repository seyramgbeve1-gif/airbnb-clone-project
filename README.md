## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### **Key Entities**

1. **User**
   - Fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `date_joined`
   - A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

2. **Property**
   - Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `location`
   - Each property belongs to one user (owner).

3. **Booking**
   - Fields: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`
   - A booking links a user to a property for specific dates.

4. **Review**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
   - A user can leave a review for a property they booked.

5. **Payment**
   - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
   - Each payment is associated with one booking.

Relationships
- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** about a **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking**.

 Feature Breakdown
 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.  
Implements authentication and authorization for secure access to user data.

### 2. **Property Management**
Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings.  
Includes photo uploads, pricing, and availability settings.

### 3. **Booking System**
Users can view available properties and make reservations.  
Includes date validation, payment integration, and booking history.

### 4. **Reviews & Ratings**
Guests can leave feedback and ratings for properties they‚Äôve stayed in.  
Helps improve credibility and user engagement.

### 5. **Payment Integration**
Secure payment processing using mock or third-party gateways (like Stripe or PayPal).  
Ensures booking confirmation and transaction integrity.

### 6. **Search and Filtering**
Allows users to search properties by location, price, or availability.  
Improves user experience and platform usability.


üîí API Security Overview

| Security Measure | Description | Importance |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Verifies user identity using tokens or sessions. | Prevents unauthorized access. |
| **Authorization** | Ensures users can only access their own data. | Protects sensitive data and user privacy. |
| **Input Validation** | Sanitizes user inputs before processing. | Prevents SQL Injection or XSS attacks. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Restricts the number of requests from a user. | Prevents DDoS attacks and abuse. |
| **Data Encryption (SSL/TLS)** | Encrypts communication between client and server. | Protects sensitive transactions like logins and payments. |


 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

**CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and deployment of the project.

### **Why It Matters**
- Detects bugs early through automated testing.  
- Reduces manual errors during deployment.  
- Enables frequent and reliable updates.  

### **Tools Used**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment.  
- **Docker:** Packages the app for consistent environments.  
- **Heroku / AWS / Render:** Hosts and serves the production version.
